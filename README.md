# 🔄 React to Next.js Migration – Skill Animation Component

This project demonstrates the migration of a component from a standard **React.js** environment to **Next.js (App Router)**. The component, `SkillDataProvider`, animates skill icons using **Framer Motion** and **react-intersection-observer** when they enter the viewport.

## 🚀 What's Inside

- ✅ Migrated to **Next.js App Router**
- 🧠 Used **Client Components** for animations and intersection observer
- 🖼️ Dynamic image rendering with `next/image`
- 🎞️ Smooth reveal animations on scroll using `framer-motion`
- 📦 Modular and reusable component
